# Kaggle Data Analysis

Welcome to the project repository! This repository contains multiple projects with a focus on data analysis and machine learning. Below is an overview of the structure and contents of the repository.

### Table of Contents
- [Breast Cancer Classification](#breast-cancer-classification)
- [Salaries Analysis](#salaries-analysis)
 

### Breast Cancer Classification üß¨

This project aims to classify breast cancer data to determine whether a tumor is benign or malignant using various machine learning techniques.

- **Metadata**: Detailed information about the dataset can be found in the [METADATA.md](breast_cancer_classification/METADATA.md) file.

- **Data**: The dataset used in this project is stored in [data.csv](breast_cancer_classification/data.csv).

### Salaries Analysis üí∞

This project involves analyzing salary data and building predictive models to forecast salaries based on different factors.

- **Notebooks:** The main analysis and model building are documented in the [analysis.ipynb](salaries_analysis/analysis.ipynb) notebook.

- **Data:** The dataset for this project is stored in [salary_data.csv](salaries_analysis/data/salary_data.csv).

- **Functions**: Reusable functions for data wrangling, plotting, and machine learning are stored in the `functions` directory. 

- **Models storage** for built Neural Network models is located in the `temp/model` directory. Currently, it contains. The saved Keras model (.keras) for salary prediction. It is pretty small due to the reduced size of the dataset.
